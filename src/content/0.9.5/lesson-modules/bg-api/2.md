## 2. Signed Endpoints - Part 1

Signed endpoints can be used in both the downloadable and the hosted versions of Fluree. 

The main signed endpoints are all structured as follows:

```
/fdb/[NETWORK-NAME]/[DBNAME-OR-DBID]/[ACTION]
```

In the hosted version, the network is "dev", and the full URL is:

```
https://db.flur.ee/api/db/[ACCOUNT]/[DBNAME]/[ACTION]
```

In the signed version, the default network is "dev" and the default port is 8080. The full URL, with defaults, is: 

```
http://localhost:8080/fdb/[ACCOUNT]/[DBNAME]/[ACTION]
```

Some of the main endpoints you'll be using are:

`/query` - POST any standard queries in FlureeQL syntax here, including analytical queries. 

`/multi-query` - POST any multi-queries in FlureeQL syntax here

`/block` - POST only block queries in FlureeQL syntax. This means queries that return a set of flakes, not standard queries that are performed as of a certain block. 

`/history` - POST only history queries in FlureeQL syntax. 

Query 1. 

```
{
    "history": ["person/handle", "jdoe"]
}
```

Query 2.

```
{
    "select": ["*"],
    "from": "person",
    "block": 2
}
```

Query 3. 

```
{
    "block": [3, 5]
}
```

Query 4. 

```
{
    "personQuery": {"select": ["*"],
    "from": "person"},
    "chatQuery": {"select": ["*"],
    "from": "chat"}
}
```
