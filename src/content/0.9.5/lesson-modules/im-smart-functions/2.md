## 2. Anatomy of a Function

The following are all the predicates that you can specify when creating a function.

Predicate | Type | Description
-- | -- | -- 
`name` | `string` | Function name
`params` | `(multi) string` | List of parameters this function supports.
`code` | `string` | Actual database code
`doc` | `string` | A docstring for this function.
`language` | `string` |  Programming language used (not yet implemented, currently only Clojure supported)
`spec` | `JSON` | (not yet implemented) Optional spec for parameters. Spec should be structured as a map, parameter names are keys and the respective spec is the value.

In the next lesson, we'll be talking a lot more about `_fn/code`, but for now take a look at an example function, which subtracts 3 from a value:

```
[{
    "_id":  "_fn",
    "name": "minus3",
    "params": ["a"],
    "code": "(- a 3)",
    "doc": "Subtracts 3 from a value, a"
}]
```

As you can see above, our code takes a parameter, `a`. We declare `a` in `_fn/params`, and we can therefore use it in our code.
