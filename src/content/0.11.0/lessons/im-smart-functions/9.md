## 9. Rules

When creating a rule, you specify a collection, predicate/s, and smart functions. That rule can then be connected to particular users and auth records. 

For example, a user can be connected to a rule regarding the `person` collection and the `person/handle` predicate. If they issue a query or transaction that includues `person/handle`, then the smart functions attached to the rule are triggered. 

- If all of the smart functions return true, then the transaction goes through or the query results get returned. 

- If at least one of the smart functions returns false, then the transaction is rejected, or, in the case of a query, the results are returned without `person/handle`.
