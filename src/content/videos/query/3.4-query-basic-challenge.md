In the previous video, you learned a lot about the basic queries in FlureeDB. You learned how to select from collections, you learned how to select particular subjects based on their ids or a unique two-tuple. And you learned how to select subjects based on a particular predicate. 

So in this video, I'm going to challenge you to use that knowledge. And what you're going to do is, is you're going to try and issue five different queries. 

I want you to select the person with the handle, `jdoe`, using that person's `_id`. 

I want you to select `jdoe` using a unique two-tuple. 

The third thing I want you to do is select all subjects that belong to the `comment` collection. 

The fourth thing is select all the subjects that contain the predicate `chat/instant`. 

And the fifth thing is select five subjects in a single query.

And these should be queries that you issue separately. You can issue multiple queries in one go, but we haven't learned that yet, so I expect you to issue query 1, make sure that's correct, issue query 2, make sure that's correct, etc. 

In the next video, I'm going to show you how I issue these five queries.
