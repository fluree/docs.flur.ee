### Transcript

Hello, welcome to the Fluree video documentation. My name is Lillian Podlog, and I'm a software engineer at Fluree. All of our documentation can be found at [docs.flur.ee](https://docs.flur.ee/docs). There, you'll find our written documentation, as well as lessons that guide you through the key concepts in Fluree, and videos like this one. 

The most comprehensive source of information about FlureeDB is the written documentation. 

As you're going through any of these materials, if you find any mistakes or have any questions, feel free to email us at support@flur.ee.

In addition, we invite anyone that is interested to join our Slack channel to continue the conversation. You can go to [launchpass.com/flureedb](https://launchpass.com/flureedb), put in your email address, and click "Join Now" to get an invitation.
