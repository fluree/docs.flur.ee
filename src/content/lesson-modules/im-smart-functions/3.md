## 3. Universal Functions - Part 1

There are two types of basic smart functions in FlureeDB:

- Universal Functions
- Context-Dependent Functions

As the names imply, universal functions can be used anywhere that smart functions can be used. Context-dependent functions are functions that retrieve certain values, and different functions are valid in different contexts. 

### Language
Clojure is the only language that is currently supported for writing smart functions, although we intend to expand the available languages. 

Only a subset of Clojure functions, as well as several built-in custom functions (written using Clojure), are allowed to be used in smart functions.

### Function List

Linked is the full list of <a href="/docs/smart-functions#universal-functions" target="_blank">all available universal functions</a>.

Function code examples:

```
(+ 12 5)                    ;; 17
(inc 10)                    ;; 11
(== 1 1)                    ;; true
(+ 12 (max 1 2 3))          ;; 15
(if-else (== 1 1) "a" "b")  ;; "a"
```

<h3>Write Function Code</h3>
<p>1. Using the above examples and the full function list to help you, write a function, which finds the minimum of 16, 10, and 23, and then adds the result to 45.</p>
<p>2. What would be the result of calling this function?</p>
