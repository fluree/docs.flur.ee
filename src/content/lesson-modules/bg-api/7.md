Request: {
            "db":"f.master",
            "user":["_user/username", "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS HERE"],
            "password": "YOUR PASSWORD HERE",
            "expireSeconds":86400
        }
```

2. Get a token for the relevant database in your account. 

```
Account: "YOUR ACCOUNT NAME"
Token: TOKEN FROM PART ONE HERE
