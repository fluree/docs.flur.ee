## 4. Signatures

This lesson does not go into detail about how to sign your requests. Rather, it explains when you should and shouldn't sign your requests. 

The signature should be the SHA3-256 of the original query, signed with your private key, according to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979" target="_blank">RFC 6979</a> standards. More information on <a href="/docs/identity/signatures" target="_blank">Signatures</a> in the Docs.

### Signing Queries

If `fdb-group-open-api` is set to true, then you do not need to sign your queries. 

If you do need to sign your queries, you should have access to your private key. Your private key needs to be <a href="/docs/identity/auth-records" target="_blank"> connected to a valid auth record</a> in the database.

Query signatures belong in the Authorization header.

### Signing Transactions

If `fdb-group-open-api` is set to true, then you do not need to sign your transactions. If you want to sign your transactions, you should submit a request to the `/cmd` endpoint.
