## 2. Permissions Structure

So far, we've explained that depending on who issues a transaction, certain smart functions might be triggered.

So how do we know who is issuing a transaction?

Identity in Fluree is determined primarily through `_auth` records. A `_user` might have more than one `_auth` record, but `_auth` records should not be shared among more than one person. In addition, every transaction is signed by an `_auth` record. 

So we know that:

A tx = Some data + a signature by an auth record. 

We don't yet know how an auth record is connected to the smart functions. We'll discuss that in the next lesson.

<h3>Questions!</h3>
<p>1. Who signs every transaction?</p>
<ul>
    <li>a. An auth record</li>
    <li>b. A user</li>
    <li>c. A smart function</li>
</ul>
<p>2. True or false? You should share auth records with multiple people.</p>
<p>3. What type of values should smart functions ultimately return?</p>
