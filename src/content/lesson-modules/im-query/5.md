## 5. Analytical Queries - Intro

FlureeQL Analytical Queries are used to answer more sophisticated questions about your data.

Analytical Queries can:

- Query across multiple internal and external datasets
- Query across the same FlureeDB at different points in time
- Calculate aggregates
- Create complicated joins

In this lesson, we will cover some of the functions of analytical queries, but not all. 

Analytical queries require two keys: select (or selectOne) and where. 

The `select` key is the list of variables that you want displayed in your results. Variables begin with a `?`, i.e. `?person`. 

The `where` key is an array of tuples, which mirror the flake-format. The variables in the `select` clause must be defined in the `where` clause.
