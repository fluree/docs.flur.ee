## 7. Analytical Queries - Example

Take a look at the below query.

```
{
    "select": "?nums",
    "where": [ 

        // Clause 1

        ["$fdb", 
        ["person/handle", "zsmith"], 
        "person/favNums", 
        "?nums"], 

        // Clause 2

        ["$fdb", 
        ["person/handle", "jdoe"], 
        "person/favNums", 
        "?nums"]
    ]
}

/* Note: In this query, select is not in an array. When selecting only one variable, we can omit the hard brackets */
```

The source for both of the clauses is `$fdb` - the current Fluree. 

The first clause has a subject of `["person/handle", "zsmith"]`, and the second clause has a subject of `"person/handle", "jdoe"]`. Both clauses are referring to a different person.

The predicate for both clauses is `person/favNums`. 

The object for both clauses is a variable, `?nums`. Remember, that when two clauses include the same variable, then we only keep values that satisfy **ALL** flake patterns.
