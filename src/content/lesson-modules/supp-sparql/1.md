## 1. SPARQL Introduction

SPARQL (pronounced "sparkle") is a query-langauge for RDF databases. 

RDF databases are also known as triple-store databases, and every fact in a triple-store database is stored a triple composed of a subject-predicate-object (SPO). 

The first three elements of a flake (subject, predicate, object) align exactly to triple-store databases' SPO triples. This lends itself to connection across Fluree and RDF databases.

You can use SPARQL to:

1. Query FlureeQL databases across time
2. Query across Fluree and non-Fluree databases, such as Wikidata and BigData.
3. Calculate aggregates
4. Create complicated joins


In additional, SPARQL is strictly a query-language. You cannot use SPARQL to transact data.

SPARQL queries, as supported in FlureeQL are comprised of a:

- SELECT clause
- WHERE clause
- PREFIXes
- Additional Options

<h3>Questions!</h3>
<br/>
<p>1. What are the first three items in a flake (in order)?</p>
<ul>
    <li>a. &nbsp;&nbsp;object, predicate, subject</li>
    <li>b. &nbsp;&nbsp;subject, predicate, object</li>
    <li>c. &nbsp;&nbsp;entity, attribute, value</li>
    <li>d. &nbsp;&nbsp;subject, predicate, object</li>
</ul>
<p>2. True or false. SPARQL is both a query and a transaction language.</p>
