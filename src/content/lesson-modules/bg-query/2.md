## 2. Querying the Movie Database
Let's imagine we have a database full of movies. This database has the following collections:

 - actor
 - credit
 - keyword
 - genre
 - language
 - country
 - productionCompany
 - movies

The code below will select all predicates from any collection. Simply replace the `_______` with the name of any collection you would like to query. 

```
{
    "select": ["*"],
    "from": "_______"
}
```
