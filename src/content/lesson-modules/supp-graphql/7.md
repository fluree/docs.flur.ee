## 7. Reverse References

In both FlureeQL and GraphQL, you can follow a reference both forwards and backwards. For example, in previous lessons, we saw that `chat/person` is a ref type. In order to see information about a person when we start from the `chat` collection, we would issue a query like the following:

```
{ graph {
    chat {
        message
        person {
            handle 
            fullName
        }
    }
}
}
```

We can also see information about chats when we start from the `person` collection. In order to do this, we need to include a predicate `chat_Via_person`, and within the curly braces following `chat_Via_person`, we specify any chat predicates we want displayed: 

```
{ graph {
  person {
    chat_Via_person {
      _id
      instant
      message
    }
  }
}
}
```
