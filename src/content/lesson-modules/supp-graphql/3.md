## 3. Basic Queries: Part 2

Now it's your turn to write some GraphQL queries! Use the below query for reference:

```
{ graph {
  chat {
    _id
    message
  }
}
}
```

Note: The text editor on the right will show an error when you type a GraphQL query. That's okay! Your answer still might be right!
