## 8. Sort By

GraphQL queries allow you to sort any field at any level in the graph. In order to perform a sort, you need to specify both the predicate name and whether you would like to sort the values by ascending or descending values.

In the below example, we are sorting chat messages in alphabetical order.

```
{ graph {
  chat (sort: {predicate: "message", order: ASC}) {
    _id
    instant 
    message
  }
}
}
```

The below query sorts every person alphabetically by their full name, and then sorts all of their comments from oldest to newest.

```
{ graph {
   person (sort: {predicate: "fullName", order: ASC}) {
    fullName
    comment_Via_person (sort:{predicate: "instant", order: ASC}) {
      message
      instant
    }
  }
}
}
```

For this lesson, you'll be modifying the below query:

```
{ graph {
    chat { 
        message
        person {
            handle
            fullName
            favArtists {
                name
            }
        }
    }
}
}
```
