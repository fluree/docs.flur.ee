## 6. Wildcards

Traditional GraphQL queries don't allow for wildcards, `*`, however in FlureeDB's version of GraphQL, we do accept wildcards.

For example, the below query selects all the predicates from all people:

```
{ 
    graph {
        person {
            *
        }
    }
}
```

Because this not standard GraphQL syntax, most GraphQL GUIs will throw an error, but if you submit the above query to a FlureeDB GraphQL endpoint, the query will be considered valid. 

Note: The text editor on the right will show an error when you type a GraphQL query. That's okay! Your answer still might be right!

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Write a Query!</h3>
<br/>
<p>Write a GraphQL query selecting all predicates from person, chat, and artist.</p> 

<p>Use the above query for reference.</p>
