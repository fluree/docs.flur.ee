## 6. The First Block

The first block in every FlureeDB is automatically written when a new database is created. This first block contains a series of <a href="/docs/infrastructure/system-collections" target="_blank">system collections and predicates</a>.

These collections include: `_collection`, `_predicate`, `_auth`, `_block`, and `_tx`. 

These flakes set up the collections and predicates that govern a database. You can change these initial system collections, for example to allow for <a href="/docs/schema/collections#updating-a-predicate-in-_collection" target="_blank">upsert in collections</a>. But, we do not recommend changing these system collections unless you have a good understanding of how they work and potential effects.
