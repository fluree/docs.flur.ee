## 2. Blocks

As you might have suspected, the points in time in a flake are not actually dates, they look a little more like this:

Subject | Predicate | Object | Time | Operation
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
12345 | Hair Color | Red | -9 | true
12345 | Birthday | 1/30/85 | -9 | true
12345 | Fav Nums | 7 | -10 | true
12345 | Full Name | Jane Doe | -10 | true
12345 | Fav Nums | 28 | -10 | true
12345 | Hair Color | Red | -11 | false
12345 | Hair Color | Brown | -11 | true
12345 | Fav Nums | 101 | -11 | true
<br/>

Transactions that are submitted to the database by the same request are atomic. They either all succeed or all fail. That group of transactions is considered a block. Block start with 1, and increase by 1 with each block.

Within each block, individual transactions are given a time, `t`. `t` is a more granular notion of time than a block. The order of the `t`s within a block is the order in which transactions were processed by FlureeDB. 

`t` is a negative integer, which decreases by one for every transaction. As we see above, there are multiple `t`s for every block:

Block 2: -9, -10
Block 3: -11

Information like hashes, which `t`s belong to which block, and what clock time is associated with each block is stored in additional metadata flakes. This is something we'll discuss in a later lesson. 

Challenge: 

The below two flakes are part of the same block, block 4. 


Subject | Predicate | Object | Time | Operation
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
12345 | Eye Color | Green | -12 | true
12345 | FavNums | 0 | -13 | true
