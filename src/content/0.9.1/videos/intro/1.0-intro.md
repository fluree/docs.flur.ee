### Transcript

Hello, welcome to the Fluree video documentation. My name is Lillian Podlog, and I'm a Software Engineer at Fluree. All of our documentation can be found at [docs.flur.ee](https://docs.flur.ee/docs). There, you'll find our written documentation, as well as lessons that guide you through the key concepts in Fluree, and videos like this one.

The most comprehensive source of information about Fluree is the written documentation.

As you're going through any of these materials, if you find any mistakes or have any questions, feel free to email us at support@flur.ee.

In addition, we invite anyone that is interested to <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/flureedb/shared_invite/enQtNTM1NzI4MTEzODA4LWEzNTMzN2VmYjBiODQ5MDUzODg1M2E3OTBjNGVmM2EwNmZhMGMwNTg2ZmJiZjk2MjA5NDkwYTk0OTVhODQ1Y2U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">join our Slack</a> channel to continue the conversation.

Once you're inside our Slack, you can go to the intros page and introduce yourself. Say hi, say where you're from, maybe what got you interested in Fluree in the first place. Welcome, and we hope to see you around!
