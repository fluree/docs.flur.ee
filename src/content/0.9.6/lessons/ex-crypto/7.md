## 7. Add Auth, Roles

Now, we have three rules that we need to connect to the users. 

1. In order to do this, we need to create a new role that has all three rules we created in the past two lessons.

To create a role, we need to specify:

- id : We'll use `cryptoUser`
- doc : A docstring to explain this role
- rules : We can use two tuples to reference the three rules we just created. So you don't have to refer back to the last lesson, the `_rule/id` for the rules we just created are, cantEditWalletUser, editAnyCryptoBalance, and editOwnWalletName. 

(See all <a href="/docs/infrastructure/system-collections#_role" target="_blank">_role predicates.</a>)

2. Create two new `_auth` records, which both have the `cryptoUser` role. 

To create an auth, we'll specify: 

- id : We'll use `cryptoMan` and `cryptoWoman`
- doc : A docstring to explain this auth
- roles : This is a reference to the relevant `_role`s. To reference the role we are creating in this same transaction, you'll need to use <a href="/docs/transact/basics#temporary-ids" target="_blank">tempids</a>

(See all <a href="/docs/infrastructure/system-collections#_auth" target="_blank">_auth predicates.</a>)

3. Connect `_auth` to `_user`s we created several steps back. 
The usernames from the users we created are `cryptoMan` and `cryptoWoman`. We'll need to reference those `_user`s as the value of the `_id` key. 

We'll also need to specify `_auth`: 

- auth : This is a reference to the relevant `_auth`s. To reference the auths we are creating in this same transaction, you'll need to use <a href="/docs/transact/basics#temporary-ids" target="_blank">tempids</a>
