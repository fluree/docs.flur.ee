## 1. Get Started!

We'll be making a simple cryptocurrency in Fluree. Through this example, users will be able to pay other users, and check their balances. Before you start with this example, you should have a good understanding of [transacting](/lesson/bg-transact/1), [creating a schema](/lesson/bg-schema/1), and the basics around how [smart functions](/lesson/im-smart-functions/1) work. 

When creating an application, according to [Fluree Best Practices](/docs/infrastructure/application-best-practices), we should build our application in four steps:

1. Create a schema (no smart functions yet!)
2. Add sample/initial data
3. Create auth/roles/rules
4. Add smart functions from simplest to most complicated
