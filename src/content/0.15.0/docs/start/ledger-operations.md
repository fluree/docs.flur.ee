## Ledger Operations

This section discusses the ledger operations that are possible with Fluree. 

### Creating a New Ledger
You can create a new ledger through the user interface, or through the APIs. You have the option between creating a blank ledger or a ledger from a snapshot. 

See the section for [creating a new ledger in Fluree Anywere](/api/downloaded-endpoints/downloaded-examples#-new-db) or in [Fluree On-Demand](/api/hosted-endpoints/hosted-examples#-api-action-new-database) (for Fluree On-Demand, you may have to change your version number).

### Snapshotting a Ledger

At any point, you can create a snapshot of a ledger through the user interface or APIs. 

See the section for [creating a snapshot in Fluree Anywere](/api/downloaded-endpoints/downloaded-examples#-snapshot). This feature is not currently available in Fluree On-Demand. 

### Forking a Ledger

This feature is coming soon. 

### Deleting a Ledger

You can delete a ledger through the user interface or APIs. This will delete the ledger and all associated files from all the servers in a network. If you want a record of your ledger before deleting, you can create a snapshot. 

See the section for [deleting a ledger in Fluree Anywere](/api/downloaded-endpoints/downloaded-examples#-delete-db). This feature is not currently available in Fluree On-Demand.
