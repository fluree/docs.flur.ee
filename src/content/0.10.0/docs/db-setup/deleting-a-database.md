## Deleting a Ledger

As of version 0.10.0 (formerly 0.9.5), we no longer support deleting ledgers. We will begin supporting archiving ledgers, which sets the ledger to `inactive`. In the downloadable version, you may delete ledger by manually deleting them from the file systems where they are stored.
