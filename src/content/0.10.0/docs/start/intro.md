## Intro to Fluree Docs

### What is Fluree?
Fluree is an immutable, time-ordered blockchain ledger. 

Each block is an atomic update that is cryptographically signed to prevent tampering and linked to the previous block in the chain.

The middle block is deconstructed to show: the previous block's hash, the current block's hash, data, a timestamp, and the block index">


You can run Fluree privately or as part of a federated network.  

A private Fluree is a ledger run on a single server, either by you or hosted for you by Fluree. A private Fluree gives you access to features such as time-travel queries and rich permission logic.

A federated Fluree is a group of ledgers shared by network. In addition to all the features of a private instance of Fluree, having a federated group of ledgers provides additional data integrity. With a federated blockchain, the network uses an agreed-upon consensus algorithm to reach a shared state.  

You can find more in-depth information about both invididual [datasebase infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/db-infrastructure) and [network infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/network-infrastructure) in later sections. 

This documentation covers all the information you need in order to run either a private or federated version of Fluree. 

### How Can I Get Started?

There are three main options to start learning about Fluree:

#### Guided Lessons
The [Guided Lessons](/lesson) on this site guides you through key concepts in Fluree and let you try queries and transaction directly from this site. While the lessons are a good introduction, they are not comprehensive. It is a good idea to work through the lessons and then reference the docs for any additional information you need. 

#### Videos
The [Videos](/video) on this site show screen captures of how-to-use Fluree combined with relevant narration (we are working on closed caption and video transcripts as well).
The videos are not comprehensive, but are a good reference for particular topics.
