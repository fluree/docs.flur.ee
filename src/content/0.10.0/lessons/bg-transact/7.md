## 7. Deleting a Subject

To delete/retract an entire subject, use the _id key along with only "_action": "delete". This deletes (retracts) the subject all predicates. In addition, all of the references for that subject anywhere in the ledger are also retracted.

```
[{
  "_id":      ["person/handle", "jdoe"],
  "_action":  "delete"
}]
```

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Delete!</h3>
<h4>Write a transaction</h4>
<br/>
<p>Using the above transaction example, write a transaction deleting the subject with id 12345.</p>
<br/>
<p>After you click "Get Solution", you'll be able to see the solution.</p>
