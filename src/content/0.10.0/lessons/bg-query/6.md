## 6. Selecting From a Specific Predicate
So far, you've seen three different options for the "from" clause in a query: 

1. From a collection, `"from": "actor"`
2. From a subject id, `"from": 1893207`
3. From a unique two-tuple: `"from": ["actor/name", "Angelina Jolie"]`

You can also select every subject that has a specific predicate. For example, if you're interested in only movies that have the predicate `movie/originalTitle`, you can issue the query: 

```
{
    "select": ["*"],
    "from": "movie/originalTitle"
}
```

The above query will return all the predicates from all subjects that have a `movie/originalTitle`.

<h4>Quiz Question:</h4>
<p>Will this query return:
<ul>
    <ol>a. All predicate for all predicates that are unique</ol>
    <ol>b. All predicates for all predicates that contain the `_predicate/unique` predicate?<ol>
</ul>
