## 1. Selecting From a Collection

A Fluree schema consists of **collections** and **predicates**. 

### Collections
Collections are similar to a relational database's tables. 

Collections organize changes about a type of subject, i.e. customers, invoices, employees. If you have a new subject type, you'd create a new collection to hold it.

### Predicates
Predicates are similar to a relational database's columns - they are the features of collections. For example `customer/firstName`, `customer/lastName`, etc.

<h3>Using the Lessons</h3>
<p>
You won't be able to actually submit queries and transactions in these lessons (yet), but we suggest you attempt to answer the challenges, and check your answer against the result in "Get Solution".
</p>

<p>For this first lesson, there won't be a challenge, but we'll show you the query for viewing all collections, and you're welcome to type it in for practice.</p>

```
{ 
    "select": ["*"],
    "from": "_collection"
}
```
