## 4. Multiple Queries and Review

You can submit multiple queries at once (you'll have to use the `multi-query` endpoint but more on this later).

In order to do so, you'll need to create an object where the keys are the names of your queries, and the values are your actual queries. The template looks like this:

```
{
    "query1": { .... Your query here .....},
    "query2": { .... Your query here .....},
    "query3": { .... Your query here .....}
}
```

Note the keys, "query1", "query2", and "query3" do not matter - they can be anything that you want to call them. The result will return your results (and any errors) in the following format: 

```
{
    "query1": [ .... Results or error here .....],
    "query2": [ .... Results or error here .....],
    "query3": [ .... Results or error here .....]
}
```

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Can you figure out how to submit the following three queries at once?</h3>
    <p> 
        <ol>
            <li>Select everything from the `language` collection.</li>
            <li>Select every predicate from the production company with the name (`productionCompany/name`) "Miramax"</li>
            <li>Select every predicate from the subject with the `_id` 1893207</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Try typing your own solution first, before clicking "Get Solution" to check your answer.</p>
