Congratulations! You've gotten through Basics: Schema. By now, you should have a good idea of how to create a basic schema.

To summarize, in this section you've learned:

1. What collections and predicates are (<a href="/lesson/bg-schema/1" target="_blank">Lesson 1</a> or <a href="/docs/getting-started/basic-schema#overview" target="_blank">Docs: Basic Schema Overview</a>)
<br/>
<br/>
2. How to create collections
(<a href="/lesson/bg-schema/2" target="_blank">Lesson 2</a> or <a href="/docs/getting-started/basic-schema#adding-collections" target="_blank">Docs: Adding Collections</a>)
<br/>
<br/>
3. How to create predicates
(<a href="/lesson/bg-schema/3" target="_blank">Lesson 3 + 4</a> or <a href="/docs/getting-started/basic-schema#adding-predicates" target="_blank">Docs: Adding Predicates</a>)
<br/>
<br/>
4. Adding Sample Data
(<a href="/lesson/bg-schema/5" target="_blank">Lesson 5 + 6</a> or <a href="/docs/getting-started/basic-schema#adding-sample-data" target="_blank">Docs: Adding Sample Data</a>)

You'll need a lot of these skills to answer the challenge question. Click on the links to refresh your memory.

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Add a Collection and 2 Predicates</h3>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a collection `book`. </li>
        <li>Create predicate `book/title` that is unique. Make sure to specify a type</li>
        <li>Create a predicate `book/author` that references a `person`</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>Try typing your own solution first before clicking "Get Solution" to check your answer. </p>

In this section, you learned a little bit about adding new data to your ledger, if you click "Next", you'll go to the "Basics: "Transacting" lesson and learn a lot more about adding, updating, and deleting data. Or you can go to [Lessons Home](/lesson) to choose the next topic you want to master!
