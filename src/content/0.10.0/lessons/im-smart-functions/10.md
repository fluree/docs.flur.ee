## 10. In Transactions

Smart functions can also be used directly in transaction to derive a particular value. The role of smart functions directly used in transactions is to derive objects NOT to accept/reject transactions.

To use smart functions directly in transactions, we need to put our code inside of a string, and prefix the code with a `#`. 

For example, to add ", Sr." to the end of a person's full name, we can use two built-in smart functions, `str` and `?pO`. `str` concatenates strings, and `?pO` retrieves the previous object. In this case, we expect the final object of `person/fullName` to be `Jane Doe, Sr.`.

```
[{
  "_id": ["person/handle", "jdoe"],
  "fullName": "#(str (?pO) \", Sr.\")"
}]
```

<h3>Write a Transaction</h3>
<p>Write a transaction that add a new `favNum` to `["person/handle", "jdoe"]` using a smart function in the transaction.</p>
<p>Remember, because `person/favNums` is a multi predicate, the object of the predicate has to be inside of square brackets.</p>
