## 5. Basic Queries: Part 4

In GraphQL, when a predicate is of type `ref`, you can open up a second set of curly braces, and specify any predicates of the referenced collection inside of the curly braces.

In the below example, `chat/person` is a `ref`, and we want to see all `person/handle`s and person subject ids.

```
{ graph {
  chat {
    _id
    message
    person {
        _id
        handle
    }
  }
}
}
```

Note: The text editor on the right will show an error when you type a GraphQL query. That's okay! Your answer still might be right!
