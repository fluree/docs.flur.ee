Now we are ready to learn how to perform transactions in FlureeDB. If we go over to our documentation and [Transact - Transaction Basics - Transact Keys](/docs/transact/basics/transact#transact-keys) we will see that there are two main 'transact keys'. The first one is `_id`, remember that every subject in our ledger has a unique long `_id` and when we are adding, updating or deleting any subject - we need to reference that `_id`. If we are adding a subject, we will need to add a temporary `_id`. But if we are updating or deleting a subject we will need to reference that subject `_id` - either by providing the actual `_id` or providing a unique two-tuple and we will see examples of adding, deleting, and updating subjects throughout the rest of the videos. And we also have an `_action` key that is optional. The `_action` is either `add`, `update`, `upsert`, or `delete`, and most of the time, that action key's value can be inferred. In the next video, we are going to talk a little bit about 'Temporary IDs'.
