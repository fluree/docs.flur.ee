# Concepts

This section covers common themes and questions that come up when running Fluree. For example, Identity Management and Decentralized Fluree.

The Concepts section is not comprehensive and is intended to serve as a complement to the technical documentation found in:

- [Overview](overview/about.md): overall technical documentation.
- [Guides](guides/guides.md): API endpoints for both download Fluree, as well as Fluree-On-Demand.
- [Reference](reference/reference.md): covers all the information you need in order to run either a private or federated version of Fluree
