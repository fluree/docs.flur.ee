# Schema Basics

A Fluree schema consists of **collections** and **predicates**.

## Collections {#collections}

Collections are similar to a relational ledger's tables.

Collections organize changes about a type of subject, i.e. `customer`s, `invoice`s, `employee`s. If you have a new subject type, you'd create a new collection to hold it.

## Predicates {#predicates}

Predicates are similar to a relational ledger's columns. For example, for the collection `customer`, predicates could be: `customer/firstName`, `customer/lastName`, etc.

Note that there are a number of built-in collections that are automatically created with every new Fluree instance.

## Deciding on Collections {#deciding-on-collections}

In this section, we are going to create a schema for a comment board application where users talk about their favorite artists.

This comment board will allow people to list information about themselves, create new chat messages, and comment on existing chats.
