# Limit

GraphQL queries allow you to limit the number of results that appear for a multi, ref predicate. In order to perform a limit, you can specify an integer.

In the below example, we are querying all people, and limiting the number of `chat_Via_person` returned.

```graphql
{
  graph {
    person {
      _id
      handle
      chat_Via_person(limit: 10) {
        instant
        message
        comments {
          message
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For this lesson, you'll be modifying the below query:

```graphql
{
  graph {
    person {
      _id
      handle
      favArtists {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Modify a Query!</h3>
<br/>
<p>Modify the last query in this lesson to limit the number of favArtists to 1.</p>

<p>Use the above queries for reference.</p>
</div>
