# Block Queries

Block queries allow you to see all of the flakes from a single block or a collection of blocks. Block queries are structured a little differently than basic queries.

You can select flakes from a single block:

```graphql
query {
  block(from: 3, to: 3)
}
```

From a range of blocks, inclusive.

```graphql
query {
  block(from: 1, to: 3)
}
```

From a range of blocks, starting from a lower limit, inclusive:

```graphql
query {
  block(from: 3)
}
```

<div class="challenge">
