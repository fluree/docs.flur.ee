# Select, As Of Block

Every time we issue a new set of transactions in Fluree, that is a new block.

Every block is an atomic (indivisible) update that is cryptographically signed by the issuer. Each time a block is committed, the block number increases by 1.

If we don't specify a block number in a query, the results will just return using the most recent block.

## Querying, As of a Single Block {#querying-as-of-a-single-block}

If we want to submit a query as of a certain block, add a key of "block" to your query with an integer as the value. We call these "time-travel" queries.

For example, to get 50 movies, as of block 2, we could issue:

```json
{
    "select": ["*"],
    "from": "movie",
    "limit": 50, 
    "block": 2
}
```

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Select 10 Credits (`credit`), as of Block 3</h3>
</div>
