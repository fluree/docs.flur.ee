# Select, As Of Time

When performing time-travel queries, we may not always know what block number we want to query. In addition to specifying a block number, we can also specify a time or a duration of time from the present.  

## Querying, As of a Time {#querying-as-of-a-time}

If we want to submit a query as of a certain time, the value for the "block" key should be a time in [ISO-8601 date format](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001437-13/reference/r_iso_8601_date_format.htm).

For example, to query all actors as of December 2, 2018 at 2pm GMT, we could issue:

```json
{
    "select": ["*"],
    "from": "actor",
    "block": "2018-12-02T14:00:00.000Z"
}
```

Note the "Z" at the end means GMT, or Greenwich Mean Time.
