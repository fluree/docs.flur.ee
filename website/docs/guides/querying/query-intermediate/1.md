# Limiting Results

Before you begin this section, you should have completed [Basics Querying #1](/lesson/bg-query/1) or have a good understanding of basic Fluree queries.

## Setting Limits {#setting-limits}

Let's say we have a ledger with thousands of movies in it. We might not want to see every single movie when we issue a query. We can limit the number of results that are returned by simply adding a key, "limit" to our query. The value of that key should be the number of subjects we do want to see.

For example, to select 100 movies:

```json
{
    "select": ["*"],
    "from": "movie",
    "limit": 100
}
```

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Select 50 Actors</h3>
<p>
Select 50 actors from the `actor` collection.
</p>
</div>
