# History Queries, Based on Flake Format

Data in Fluree is stored in the form of [flakes](/concepts/core-concepts/flakes.md). The flake format is an array where the first three elements specify an [subject, predicate, and object](/concepts/what-is-fluree.md#subject-predicate-object-model) in that order.

You can see the history of any flakes that match a certain pattern. Specifiying either a predicate or a subject is required.

For example, to query the history of updates to the `person/follows` predicate on the `["person/handle", "zsmith"]` subject, you could issue the following query:

```json
{
  "history": [["person/handle", "zsmith"], "person/follows"]
}
```

If, however, we were interested in looking at flakes that matched any subject with the predicate, `person/handle`, and the object, jdoe, we would issue:

```json
{
  "history": [null, "person/handle", "jdoe"]
}
```

If we skip the subject, we need to put `null`, whereas we can just omit a flake-pattern without an object (because it is at the end of our array).
