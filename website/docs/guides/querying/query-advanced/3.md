# History Queries

History queries allow you to see the history of a subject or the history of a set of flakes that fit a certain pattern.

To see the history (all flakes pertaining to) a particular subject using that subject's id:

```json
{
  "history": 4299262263302
}
```

Or using a unique two-tuple:

```json
{
  "history": ["person/handle", "zsmith"]
}
```

You can optionally include a `block` key, with the most recent block (integer) for which to list history.

```json
{
  "history": ["person/handle", "zsmith"],
  "block": 2
}
```
