# Block Queries

Before you begin this section, you should have completed the
[Intermediate Querying Lesson](guides/querying/query-intermediate/1.md) or have a good
understanding of basic Fluree queries. Completion of the
[Flakes and Blocks Lesson](/guides/advanced/flakes-and-blocks/1.md) or a good understanding of
flakes is also helpful. In addition, you should know about the subject-predicate-object model.

## Querying Blocks {#querying-blocks}

If we want to see all of the flakes that belong to a particular block, you can use a block number, an ISO-8601 formatted string or an ISO-8601 formatted duration.

Using block number:

```json
{
  "block": 4
}
```

Using ISO-8601 formatted wall clock time:

```json
{
  "block": "2017-11-14T20:59:36.097Z"
}
```

Using ISO-8601 formatted duration (as of 1 hour ago):

```json
{
  "block": "PT1H"
}
```
