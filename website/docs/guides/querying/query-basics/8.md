# Crawling the Relationships: Part 2

As we saw in the previous example, some predicates in our ledger are of type, `ref`, meaning they are __***references***__ to other subjects in the ledger.

In order to fully understand this concept, let's go through another example based off of our `productionCompany` collection, which has the following predicates:

- productionCompany/name
- productionCompany/id
- productionCompany/country

The `productionCompany/country` predicate is a reference to subjects in the `country` collection. If we issue the following query:

```json
{
    "select": ["*"],
    "from": "productionCompany"
}
```

We will get a response that looks like this:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "result": [
    {
      "productionCompany/id": 94552,
      "productionCompany/name": "Flatiron Pictures",
      "_id": 4299262268343
    },
    {
      "productionCompany/id": 5486,
      "productionCompany/name": "Darius Films",
      "_id": 4299262268342
    },
    {
      "productionCompany/id": 11444,
      "productionCompany/name": "Lumiere",
      "_id": 4299262268341
    }
    "..."
  ]
}
```

As you can see, we don't automatically see any information about where the production company is located. We only see their _id, `"productionCompany/id": 94552` and their name, `"productionCompany/name": "Lumiere"`. In order to view all the predicates for productionCompany, we need to specify `{"productionCompany/country": ["*"]}` in our query:

```json
{
    "select": ["*", {"productionCompany/country": ["*"]}],
    "from": "productionCompany"
}
```

The above query will not only select all, `"select": ["*",` predicates from every productionCompany, but select all country predicates from the productionCompany referenced in country,`"select": ["*", {"productionCompany/country": ["*"]}]`.

The results will mirror the shape of our query:

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "result": [
    {
      "productionCompany/id": 94552,
      "productionCompany/name": "Flatiron Pictures",
      "productionCompany/country": {
        "country/iso_3166_1": "US",
        "country/name": "United States of America",
        "_id": 4303557230679
      },
      "_id": 4299262268343
    }
    "..."
  ]
}
```

** Note that there is no `ref` to productionCompany in the country collection, so this query will not work! It is just listed here as an example.
