# Selecting From a Collection

A Fluree schema consists of **collections** and **predicates**.

## Collections {#collections}

Collections are similar to a relational ledger's tables.

Collections organize changes about a type of subject, i.e. customers, invoices, employees. If you have a new subject type, you'd create a new collection to hold it.

## Predicates {#predicates}

Predicates are similar to a relational ledger's columns - they are the features of collections. For example `customer/firstName`, `customer/lastName`, etc.
