# 1. Cryptography Overview

This section will cover two key concepts:

1. Hash functions
2. Elliptic-curve Cryptography

These two concepts are critical to understanding how Fluree verifies identities and secures data.

This section will guide you to a high-level understanding of these two concepts, and will not delve into the math that underpines both hash functions and elliptic -curve cryptography.

None of the concepts covered in this sections are unique to Fluree, although this lesson will cover the how these concepts are used in Fluree. The documentation section on [Identity](/concepts/identity/auth_records.md#generating_keys) is where we talk about how public-private key cryptography is used in Fluree. Hashes are used in [block metadata](/overview/schema/metadata.md).
