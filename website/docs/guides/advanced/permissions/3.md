# Auth/ Roles/ Rules

Auth records contain a number of predicates, including:

- id: A globally unique id for this auth record
- doc: A docstring for this auth record
- roles: Reference to roles (can be multiple roles)

The main purpose of roles is group a set of rules under that same name. Role names (`_role/id`) tend to be descriptive, like "ledgerAdmin", "chatModerator", "chatUser", etc. Role predicates include:

- id: A unique name for this role
- doc: A docstring for this role
- rules: Reference to rules (can be multiple rules)

In the next lesson, we'll learn a little more about rules.
