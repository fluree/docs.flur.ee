# Permissions Structure

So far, we've explained that depending on who issues a transaction, certain smart functions might be triggered.

So how do we know who is issuing a transaction?

Identity in Fluree is determined primarily through `_auth` records. A `_user` might have more than one `_auth` record, but `_auth` records should not be shared among more than one person. In addition, every transaction is signed by an `_auth` record.

So we know that:

A tx = Some data + a signature by an auth record.

We don't yet know how an auth record is connected to the smart functions. We'll discuss that in the next lesson.
