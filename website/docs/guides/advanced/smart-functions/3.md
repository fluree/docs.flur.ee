# Universal Functions - Part 1

There are two types of basic smart functions in Fluree:

- Universal Functions
- Context-Dependent Functions

As the names imply, universal functions can be used anywhere that smart functions can be used. Context-dependent functions are functions that retrieve certain values, and different functions are valid in different contexts.

## Language {#language}

Clojure is the only language that is currently supported for writing smart functions, although we intend to expand the available languages.

Only a subset of Clojure functions, as well as several built-in custom functions (written using Clojure), are allowed to be used in smart functions.

## Function List {#function-list}

Linked is the full list of <a href="/docs/smart-functions#universal-functions" target="_blank">all available universal functions</a>.

Function code examples:

```clojure
(+ 12 5)                                ;; 17
(inc 10)                                ;; 11
(== 1 1)                                ;; true
(+ 12 (max 1 2 3))              ;; 15
(if-else (== 1 1) "a" "b")   ;; "a"
```
