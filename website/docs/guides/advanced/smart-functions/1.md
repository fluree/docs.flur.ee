# Smart Functions

Before you begin this section, you should have completed all of the basic lessons, or have a good understanding of Fluree schema and adding data.

## Role of Smart Functions {#role-of-smart-functions}

Smart functions are the engine for setting permissions in Fluree.

Every time a transaction is issued, that transaction might trigger various smart functions. In addition, when an end user (not a node) issues a query, various smart functions might be triggered.

Smart functions will either return `true` or `false`. If every smart function that is triggered returns `true`, then the transaction will go through. If even one triggered smart function returns `false`, then the transaction will fail, or in the case of a query- that piece of information will not be displayed to the user.

Smart functions are stored in the `_fn` collection. From the `_fn` collection, smart functions can be referenced in a variety of places. Functions stored in different locations are triggered in slightly different ways.
