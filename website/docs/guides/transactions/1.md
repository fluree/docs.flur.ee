# Transacting

In order to successfully complete this lesson, you'll need a basic understanding of [collections and predicates](/docs/getting-started/basic-schema#overview).

In this section, we'll learn how to transact data. Transacting is adding, updating, and deleting data. The first thing we'll look at is how transactions are structured.

## Transaction Format {#transaction-format}

Every transaction that you issue needs to be inside of square brackets, `[` and `]`, and every subject that you are creating or updating needs to be inside of curly brackets `{`, and `}`.

Each of those objects inside of curly brackets will have multiple key-value pairs. The order of those key-value pairs does not matter, but each object needs to have an `_id` key.

For example, this is a valid transaction:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "person",
    "fullName": "Amelia Earhart"
  }
]
```
