# 1. Schema Basics

A Fluree schema consists of **collections** and **predicates**.

## Collections {#collections}

Collections are similar to a relational ledger's tables.

Collections organize changes about a type of subject, i.e. `customer`s, `invoice`s, `employee`s. If you have a new subject type, you'd create a new collection to hold it.

## Predicates {#predicates}

Predicates are similar to a relational ledger's columns. For example, for the collection `customer`, predicates could be: `customer/firstName`, `customer/lastName`, etc.

Note that there are a number of built-in collections that are automatically created with every new Fluree instance.

## Deciding on Collections {#deciding-on-collections}

In this section, we are going to create a schema for a comment board application where users talk about their favorite artists.

This comment board will allow people to list information about themselves, create new chat messages, and comment on existing chats.

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Decide on Collections</h3>
<p>In the text box on the top right, you can list the collections you would create if you were creating an application like the one described above.</p>
<p>After you click "Get Solution", you'll be able to see what collections we will be creating in this lesson. Note that if your collections don't match with ours, that's okay! There are many possible ways to build the same application.</p>
