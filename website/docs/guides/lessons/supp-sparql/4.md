# 4. Multiple Triples

You can include multiple triples in a single where clause. Any variables in the where clauses are bound across triples.

For example, the triple `?person fd:person/fullName ?fullName.` binds `?person` to any subject `_id` with a `person/fullName`, and `?fullName` binds to all objects of the `person/fullName` predicate.

However, if we combine multiple triples, like below, the values of `?person` and `?fullName` are different.

```sparql
SELECT ?person
WHERE {
  ?person fd:person/handle "jdoe".
  ?person fd:person/fullName ?fullName.
}
```

A ?person not only has to have a `person/fullName`, but also a `person/handle` that equals `jdoe`. Therefore, if we are using our <a href="/docs/getting-started/basic-schema" target="_blank">Basic Schema</a>, `?fullName` would only be bound to `Jane Doe`.

<p>How would you write a query that selects all `?person` and `?handle` where the one of person's favorite number (person/favNums)` is 1223?</p>
