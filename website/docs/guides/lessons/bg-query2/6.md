You'll need a lot of these skills to answer the challenge question. Click on the links to refresh your memory. You'll also need to remember how to <a href="/lesson/bg-query/4" target="_blank">write a multi-query</a> (<a href="/docs/query/advanced-query#multiple-queries">relevant section in docs</a>).

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Write a Multi-Query!</h3>
<p>There should be 5 queries in total in your multi-query:</p>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select 20 `actor`s.</li>
        <li>Select `movie`s with a `movie/revenue` under $200</li>
        <li>Select 50 `movie`s as of 20 minutes ago</li>
        <li>Select 15 `credit`s as of January 1, 2018 at 6:30 p.m. GMT</li>
        <li>Select 200 `movie`s as of block 4</li>
