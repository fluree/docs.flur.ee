# 4. Select, As Of Duration

Duration expressions represent periods of time, and in Fluree, we specifically use duration to periods of time before the present. Duration expressions in [ISO-8601 duration format](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001437-13/reference/r_iso_8601_duration_format.htm). ISO-8601 duration format always begin with a "P". Every increment of time is represented as a capital letter and the amount of that unit is placed before the letter.

Any units of time less than a day are preceded by a "T". A few examples:

- `P60Y`: 60 years ago
- `P5YT10M`: 5 years and 10 minutes ago
- `PT10H54M`: 10 hours and 54 minutes ago
- `P2Y1M20DT5H16M`: 2 years, 1 month, 20 days, 5 hours, and 16 minutes ago

There are [good resources](https://www.digi.com/resources/documentation/digidocs/90001437-13/reference/r_iso_8601_duration_format.htm) explaining more about this format.

If we wanted to select 10 actors as of 2 months ago, we could issue:

```json
{
    "select": ["*"],
    "from": "actor",
    "block": "P2M",
    "limit": 10
}
```
