# 4. Restrict Who Can Edit What

Once we have a schema and sample data, we can create some auth records, roles, and rules.

## Who Can Edit What?

The first thing we're going to do is decide who can edit which predicates in the `wallet` collection. These rules are not going to be the only restrictions on these predicates.

Note that there are multiple ways to build the same application. While there are some wrong answers (that would make it impossible to build this application), there are multiple right answers.

<h3>Who Can Edit What? You Decide</h3>

<p>1. Who should be able to edit the `wallet/name` predicate?</p>
<ul>
    <li>a. Only the user (whose wallet it is)</li>
    <li>b. Anyone but the user</li>
    <li>c. No one</li>
    <li>d. Anyone</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Who should be able to edit the `wallet/balance` predicate?</p>
<ul>
    <li>a. Only the user (whose wallet it is)</li>
    <li>b. Anyone but the user</li>
    <li>c. No one</li>
    <li>d. Anyone</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Who should be able to edit the `wallet/user` predicate?</p>
<ul>
    <li>a. Only the user (whose wallet it is)</li>
    <li>b. Anyone but the user</li>
    <li>c. No one</li>
    <li>d. Anyone</li>
</ul>
