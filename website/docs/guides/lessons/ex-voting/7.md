# 7. Preventing Voter Fraud

The `vote/yesVotes` and `vote/noVotes` predicates hold all of the auth records that voted for or against a proposed change.

We need to make sure that only the owner of a given auth record adds their auth record to yes or no votes.

To do this, we can add a spec to both of these predicates, which ensures that users only cast votes with their own auth records.

The transaction will look as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "_fn$ownAuth",
    "_fn/name": "ownAuth?",
    "_fn/code": "SMART FUNCTION CODE HERE"
  },
  {
    "_id": ["_predicate/name", "vote/yesVotes"],
    "spec": ["_fn$ownAuth"]
  },
  {
    "_id": ["_predicate/name", "vote/noVotes"],
    "spec": ["_fn$ownAuth"]
  }
]
```

It is your job to write the code of the smart function. Remember, we want to check whether the `_auth` we add to `vote/yesVotes` or `vote/noVotes` is your own `_auth`.

You will need one (or several) of these smart function to write, `ownAuth?`.

| Function | Arguments       | Example           |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| `inc`    | `n` optional    | `(inc)`           |
| `dec`    | `n` optional    | `(dec)`           |
| `==`     | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(== 1 1 1 1)`    |
| `+`      | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(+ 1 2 3)`       |
| `-`      | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(- 10 9 3)`      |
| `*`      | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(* 90 10 2)`     |
| `/`      | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(/ 36 3 4)`      |
| `>`      | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(> 90 10 2)`     |
| `<`      | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(< 90 10 2)`     |
| `>=`     | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(>= 90 90 10 2)` |
| `<`      | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(< 2 10 90)`     |
| `<=`     | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(<= 2 10 90 90)` |
| `max`    | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(max 1 2 3)`     |
| `min`    | `arg1 arg2 ...` | `(min 1 2 3)`     |

You will also need several context-specific functions. Note, you may not need all of these functions:

- `(?sid)`: The `_id` for the subject being updated.
- `(?auth_id)` : The `_id` of the auth making the update.
- `(?user_id)` : The `_id` of the user making the update.
- `(?o)`: Tthe object (value) of the predicate that is being edited.
