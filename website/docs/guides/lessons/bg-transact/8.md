# 8. Deleting Data Continued

## Delete Specific Predicates {#delete-specific-predicates}

To delete only specific predicate-objects within an subject, specify the key/value combinations.

You can delete (retract) a single predicate by setting the value of \_id to a two-tuple of the predicate and predicate value, and then setting the predicate to null. `"_action": "delete"` is inferred.

```json
[
  {
    "_id": ["person/handle", "jdoe"],
    "handle": null
  }
]
```

## Delete Specific Multi Predicates {#delete-specific-multi-predicates}

To delete (retract) only a single object from a multi predicate, specify the predicate-object, and add `"_action": "delete"`.

For example, to delete just the number, 98, from `["person/handle", "jdoe"]`'s favorite numbers, we would issue:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": ["person/handle", "jdoe"],
    "favNums": [98],
    "_action": "delete"
  }
]
```

To delete all of `["person/handle", "jdoe"]`'s favorite numbers, we would issue:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": ["person/handle", "jdoe"],
    "favNums": null
  }
]
```
