# 6. Selecting From a Specific Predicate

So far, you've seen three different options for the "from" clause in a query:

1. From a collection, `"from": "actor"`
2. From a subject id, `"from": 1893207`
3. From a unique two-tuple: `"from": ["actor/name", "Angelina Jolie"]`

You can also select every subject that has a specific predicate. For example, if you're interested in only movies that have the predicate `movie/originalTitle`, you can issue the query:

```json
{
    "select": ["*"],
    "from": "movie/originalTitle"
}
```

The above query will return all the predicates from all subjects that have a `movie/originalTitle`.

## Querying Only Predicates with `_predicate/unique`

Can you select only the predicates that contain the `_predicate/unique` predicate?

### Quiz Question

Will this query return:

- a. All predicate for all predicates that are unique
- b. All predicates for all predicates that contain the `_predicate/unique` predicate?
