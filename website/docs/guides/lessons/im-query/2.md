# 2. Block Range Queries

You can also issue queries to see all the flakes from a range of blocks.

To query a range of block, specify a lower and upper limit (inclusive).

```json
{
  "block": [3, 5]
}
```

To query a range of block, starting with a lower limit, specify just the lower limit (inclusive).

```json
{
  "block": [3]
}
```
