# 4. Basic Queries: Part 3

Remember that you can includes multiple top-level queries in a single query. See the example below for reference:

```graphql
{
  graph {
    artist {
      name
    }
    person {
      handle
      fullName
    }
  }
}
```

Note: The text editor on the right will show an error when you type a GraphQL query. That's okay! Your answer still might be right!

<div class="challenge">
