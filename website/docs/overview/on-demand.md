# Fluree On-Demand

There are two options for running Fluree:

- Fluree On-Demand
- [Fluree Anywhere](../overview/start/fluree_anywhere)

With Fluree On-Demand, we'll host your ledgers for you, and you are able to login and interact with your ledgers via a web interface. With Fluree On-Demand, you can [sign up](https://flur.ee/getstarted/) for an account and start using Fluree right away.

You will have less control of your Fluree instance:

- Fluree version is set by Fluree. We periodically update the Fluree On-Demand version, but end users do not have control of this.
- No direct access to your ledger files.
- A limit of 5 ledgers.
- Centralized ledgers only.
- Metered usage - we use fuel to meter and track usage. Fuel is reset daily.

We recommend Fluree On-Demand for anyone testing Fluree out or using Fluree for small-scale demos or proofs-of-concept. If this is right for you, you can [sign up](https://flur.ee/getstarted/) today.
