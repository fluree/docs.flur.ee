# Supply Chain

In this example, weâ€™ll walk through setting up a custom blockchain for Cafe on
the Block, a fictional coffee company that guarantees sustainably-sourced coffee
to its customers. This example is highly detailed, and only recommended for those
who have a good grasp on creating schemas, issuing transactions, and writing smart
functions. If not, we recommend working through the lessons through "Intermediate:
Smart Functions."
