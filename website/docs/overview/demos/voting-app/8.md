# 8. Proposing a Change

Let's think through how we propose a change, and what we're still missing in our application.

Right now, if `softCell` wanted to change their `_user/username` to `hardCell`, they could issue the following change and vote:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "change",
    "name": "softCellNameChange",
    "doc": "It's time for a change!",
    "subject": ["_user/username", "softCell"],
    "predicate": ["_predicate/name", "_user/username"],
    "object": "hardCell",
    "vote": "vote$softCell"
  },
  {
    "_id": "vote$softCell",
    "name": "softCellNameVote",
    "yesVotes": [["_auth/id", "auth3"]]
  }
]
```

This transaction needs to be signed with softCell's private key to be valid.

There's one big problem, however... The problem has nothing to do with the syntax of the transaction (that's all good!). Can you figure out what our big problem is?
