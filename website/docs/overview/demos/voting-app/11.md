# Get Yes and No Votes

If a predicate-object pair in a transaction triggers the smart function, `vote`, then it will look up the votes for the relevant subject-predicate-object triple.

This function will return the same map (minus meta-data) that is returned when you issue the specified query normally.

We can use the `get-all` built-in smart function to get all the yes and no votes.

For example, the function to get all the no votes is:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "_fn",
    "name": "noVotes",
    "code": "(get-all (nth (vote) 0) [\"vote/noVotes\" \"_id\"] )"
  }
]
```

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Add a the yesVotes Function</h3>
<br/>
<p>Use the same pattern as above to write a transaction that creates a new function, yesVotes, which retrieves all of the yes votes. </p>

</div>
