# Create a Cryptocurrency

We'll be making a simple cryptocurrency in Fluree. Through this example, users will be able to pay
other users, and check their balances. Before you start with this example, you should have a good
understanding of [transacting](/guides/transactions/1.md), [creating a schema](/guides/schema/1.md),
and the basics around how [smart functions](/guides/advanced/smart-functions/1.md) work.

When creating an application, according to
[Fluree Best Practices](/concepts/infrastructure/best_practices.md), we should build our
application in four steps:

1. Create a schema (no smart functions yet!)
2. Add sample/initial data
3. Create auth/roles/rules
4. Add smart functions from simplest to most complicated
