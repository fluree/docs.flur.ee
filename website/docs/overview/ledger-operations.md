# Ledger Operations

This section discusses the ledger operations that are possible with Fluree.

## Creating a New Ledger {#creating-a-new-ledger}

You can create a new ledger through the user interface, or through the APIs.

See the section for [creating a new ledger in Fluree Anywere](/api/downloaded-endpoints/downloaded-examples#-new-db).  You will need to change your version number to test the feature in [Fluree On-Demand](on-demand.md).

## Forking a Ledger {#forking-a-ledger}

This feature is coming soon.

## Deleting a Ledger {#deleting-a-ledger}

You can delete a ledger through the user interface or APIs. This will delete the ledger and all associated files from all the servers in a network.

See the section for [deleting a ledger in Fluree Anywere](/api/downloaded-endpoints/downloaded-examples#-delete-db). This feature is not currently available in Fluree On-Demand.
