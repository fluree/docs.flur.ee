# Transactions
Fluree allows you to specify transaction using FlureeQL JSON array/vector syntax that contains entity maps to create, update, upsert or delete. Transactions can also be done with GraphQL, for more information on on GraphQL transactions, reference the GraphQL Transactions section. 

Each map requires an `_id` as specified below along with key/value pairs containing the attributes and values you wish to modify. An `_action` key is always included, but typically inferred and thus optional for most operations.

Key | Type | Description
-- | -- | -- 
`_id` | identity |  Any identity value which can include the numeric assigned permanent `_id` for an entity, any attribute marked as unique as a two-tuple, i.e. `["_user/username", "jdoe"]`, or a temporary id (for new entities), i.e. `["_user", -1]`.
`_action` | string | Optional (if it can be inferred). One of: `add`, `update`, `upsert` or `delete`. When using a temporary id, `add` is always inferred. When using an existing identity, `update` is always inferred. `upsert` is inferred for new entities with a tempid if they include an attribute that was marked as `upsert`.

To delete/retract an entire entity, use the `_id` key along with only `"_action": "delete"`. To delete only specific values within an entity, specify the key/value combinations.

The keys can contain the full attribute name including the namespace, i.e. `chat/message` or you can leave off the namespace if it is the same as the stream the entity is within. i.e. when the entity is within the `chat` stream, just `message` can be used which is translated to `chat/message` by Fluree.

## Adding Data

In order to add data, you must use a temporary `_id`, i.e. `["_chat", -1]`. In this case, `"_action": "add"` is inferred. Any attributes that you wish to add to this entity should be included as key-value pairs. 

Curl example:

```
curl \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $FLUREE_TOKEN" \
   -d '[{"_id": ["chat", -1], "message": "Hello, sample chat message."}]' \
   https://ACCOUNT_NAME.beta.flur.ee/api/db/transact
```

#### Insert two new entities using temp-ids (note `"_action": "add"` is inferred)

```json
[{
  "_id":      ["person", -1],
  "handle":   "jdoe",
  "fullName": "Jane Doe"
},
{
  "_id":      ["person", -2],
  "handle":   "zsmith",
  "fullName": "Zach Smith"
}]
```
```curl
curl \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $FLUREE_TOKEN" \
   -d '[{
  "_id":      ["person", -1],
  "handle":   "jdoe",
  "fullName": "Jane Doe"
},
{
  "_id":      ["person", -2],
  "handle":   "zsmith",
  "fullName": "Zach Smith"
}]'\
   https://$FLUREE_ACCOUNT.beta.flur.ee/api/db/transact
```

```graphql
mutation addPeople ($myPeopleTx: JSON) {
  transact(tx: $myPeopleTx
}

/* You can learn more about structuring GraphQL transactions in the section, 'GraphQL Transactions'. */

{
  "myPeopleTx": "[{ \"_id\": [\"person\", -1], \"handle\": \"jdoe\", \"fullName\": \"Jane Doe\" }, { \"_id\": [\"person\", -2], \"handle\": \"zsmith\", \"fullName\": \"Zach Smith\" }]"
}
```

## Updating Data

In order to update data, you can reference an existing entity by using its `_id` or, for any attribute marked as unique as a two-tuple, i.e. `["_user/username", "jdoe"]`. Attributes that you wish to update should be included as key-value pairs.

When referencing an existing entity,  `"_action": "update"` is inferred.

Curl example:

```
curl \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $FLUREE_TOKEN" \
   -d '[{
  "_id":      ["person/handle", "jdoe"],
  "fullName": "Jane Doe Updated By Identity"
}]' \
   https://$FLUREE_ACCOUNT.beta.flur.ee/api/db/transact
```

#### Update an existing entity using an identity value (note `"_action": "update"` is inferred)

```json
[{
  "_id":      ["person/handle", "jdoe"],
  "fullName": "Jane Doe Updated By Identity"
}]
```
```curl
curl \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $FLUREE_TOKEN" \
   -d '[{
  "_id":      ["person/handle", "jdoe"],
  "fullName": "Jane Doe Updated By Identity"
}]' \
   https://$FLUREE_ACCOUNT.beta.flur.ee/api/db/transact
```

```graphql
mutation updatePerson($myUpdatePersonTx: JSON) {
  transact(tx: $myUpdatePersonTx)
}

{
  "myUpdatePersonTx": "[{ \"_id\": [\"person/handle\", \"jdoe\"], \"fullName\": \"Jane Doe Updated By Identity\" }]"
}
```
#### Update an existing entity using internal `_id` value (note `"_action": "update"` is inferred)

```json
[{
  "_id":      4294967296001,
  "fullName": "Jane Doe Updated By Numeric _id"
}]
```
```curl
curl \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $FLUREE_TOKEN" \
   -d '[{
  "_id":      4294967296001,
  "fullName": "Jane Doe Updated By Numeric _id"
}]' \
   https://$FLUREE_ACCOUNT.beta.flur.ee/api/db/transact
   ```

```graphql
mutation updateById ($myUpdateByIdTx: JSON) {
  transact(tx: $myUpdateByIdTx)
}

{
  "myUpdateByIdTx": "[{ \"_id\": 4294967296001, \"fullName\": \"Jane Doe Updated By Numeric _id\" }]"
}
```
## Upserting Data

When a transaction with a tempid resolves to an existing entity, `"_action": "upsert"` is inferred. This is only applicable to attributes marked as unique. By default the transaction will throw an exception if a conflict with a unique attribute exists.

If "person/handle" is marked as unique and `["person/handle", "jdoe"]` is already in our database, this transaction will simply update `["person/handle", "jdoe"]`. If `["person/handle", "jdoe"]` is not yet in the database, it will add the new entity.  

Curl example:

```
curl \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $FLUREE_TOKEN" \
   -d '[{
  "_id":      ["person", -1],
  "handle": "jdoe"
}]' \
   https://$FLUREE_ACCOUNT.beta.flur.ee/api/db/transact
```

#### Upsert into an existing entity (note `"_action": "upsert"` is inferred when a tempid resolves to an existing entity with a unique attribute)

```json
[{
  "_id":      ["person", -1],
  "handle": "jdoe"
}]
```
```curl
curl \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $FLUREE_TOKEN" \
   -d '[{
  "_id":      ["person", -1],
  "handle": "jdoe"
}]' \
   https://$FLUREE_ACCOUNT.beta.flur.ee/api/db/transact
   ```

```graphql
mutation updateById ($myUpdateByIdTx: JSON) {
  transact(tx: $myUpdateByIdTx)
}

{
  "myUpdateByIdTx": "[{ \"_id\": [\"person\", -1], \"handle\": \"jdoe\" }]"
}
```

## Deleting Data 

You can delete (retract) a single attribute by setting the value of `_id` to a two-tuple of the attribute and attribute value, and then setting the attribute to null. `"_action": "delete"` is inferred. 


Curl example:

```
curl \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $FLUREE_TOKEN" \
   -d '[{
  "_id":      ["person/handle", "jdoe"],
  "handle":   null
}]' \
   https://$FLUREE_ACCOUNT.beta.flur.ee/api/db/transact
   
```

You can delete (retract) all attributes for an entity by setting the value of `_id` to a two-tuple of the attribute and attribute value, and then specifying `"_action": "delete"`. 


#### Delete (retract) a single attribute

```json
[{
  "_id":      ["person/handle", "jdoe"],
  "handle":   null
}]
```

```curl
curl \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $FLUREE_TOKEN" \
   -d '[{
  "_id":      ["person/handle", "jdoe"],
  "handle":   null
}]' \
   https://$FLUREE_ACCOUNT.beta.flur.ee/api/db/transact
   ```

```graphql
mutation deleteAttribute ($myDeleteAttributeTx: JSON) {
  transact(tx: $myDeleteAttributeTx)
}

{
  "myDeleteAttributeTx": "[{ \"_id\": [\"person/handle\", \"jdoe\"], \"handle\": null }]"
}
```

#### Delete (retract) all attributes for an entity

```json
[{
  "_id":      ["person/handle", "jdoe"],
  "_action":  "delete"
}]
```
```curl
curl \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $FLUREE_TOKEN" \
   -d '[{
  "_id":      ["person/handle", "jdoe"],
  "_action":  "delete"
}]' \
   https://$FLUREE_ACCOUNT.beta.flur.ee/api/db/transact
```
```graphql
mutation deleteAllAttributes ($myDeleteAllAttributesTx: JSON) {
  transact(tx: $myDeleteAllAttributesTx)
}

{
  "myDeleteAllAttributesTx": "[{ \"_id\": [\"person/handle\", \"jdoe\"], \"_action\": \"delete\" }]"
}
```

## Database Functions

Database functions allow you to atomically update an attribute's value based on the existing value (represented by the symbol `?v`), or substitute in a value such as the current time with `(now)`. The functions allow capabilities such as an atomic counter and compare-and-set. Fluree supports the following database functions, and is continuing to expand the database functions available.

Functions used as values in transactions should be prepended with `#` to indicate it is a function and not a string value.

Function | Example | Description
-- | -- | -- 
`inc` | `#(inc ?v)` |  Atomic increment existing value by 1. Works on `integer`.
`dec` | `#(dec ?v)` | Atomic decrement existing value by 1. Works on `integer`.
`+` | `#(+ ?v 5)` | Increment existing value by specified number. Works on `integer`, `float`.
`-` | `#(- ?v 5)`| Decrement existing value by specific number. Works on `integer`, `float`.
`now` | `#(now)` | Insert current server time. Works on `instant`.
`cas` | `#(cas ?v "brown" "blue")` | Will compare current value to the first argument, and if equal, sets the value to the second argument. If not equal, transaction throws an exception. Works on all types.
