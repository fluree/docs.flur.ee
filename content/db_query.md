# Query

## Overview

Fluree allows you to specify queries using our FlureeQL JSON syntax or with GraphQL. The FlureeQL format designed to easily enable code to compose queries, as the query is simply a data structure. 

For each query, the user's permissions create a special filtered database that only contains what the user can see. You can safely issue any query, never having to worry about accidentally exposing permissioned data.

Both FlureeQL and GraphQL give the ability to issue multiple queries in the same request, this can be used to reduce round-trips for end-user applications.
