## Introduction

The Fluree platform provides a centralized data store and microservices platform for enterprises who want to streamline the deployment and management of the applications their business runs on.

We've seen first-hand how difficult it is to get differing applications written by different teams to share data, respect the same permissions, and evolve concurrently without breaking API contracts. The Fluree platform is designed to allow teams to iterate quickly on their own applications while retaining backward compatibility.

An application on Fluree consists of a configuration file and (optionally) a Docker image running a webserver.
