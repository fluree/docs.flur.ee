# In Transactions

Smart functions can also be used directly in transaction to derive a particular value. The role of smart functions directly used in transactions is to derive objects NOT to accept/reject transactions.

To use smart functions directly in transactions, we need to put our code inside of a string, and prefix the code with a `#`.

For example, to add ", Sr." to the end of a person's full name, we can use two built-in smart functions, `str` and `?pO`. `str` concatenates strings, and `?pO` retrieves the previous object. In this case, we expect the final object of `person/fullName` to be `Jane Doe, Sr.`.

```json
[
  {
    "_id": ["person/handle", "jdoe"],
    "fullName": "#(str (?pO) \", Sr.\")"
  }
]
```
