# Collection Spec

A `_collection/spec` is set of smart functions that are attached to a particular collection. Any time that collection appears in a transaction, regardless of who issues the transaction, the smart functions attached to the `_collection/spec` will execute.

If all of the smart functions return `true`, the transaction will succeed. If any of the smart functions return `false`, it will fail.

## Uses {#uses}

The most common use for collection specs to make sure a certain predicate is included in a collection. For example, the below spec, the function makes sure `person/fullName` is required.

```json
[
  {
    "_id": ["_collection/name", "person"],
    "spec": ["_fn$fullNameReq"],
    "specDoc": "A person is required to have a fullName."
  },
  {
    "_id": "_fn$fullNameReq",
    "name": "fullNameReq",
    "code": "(boolean (get (query (str \"{\\\"select\\\": [\\\"*\\\"], \\\"from\\\":\" (?sid) \"}\")) \"person/fullName\"))"
  }
]
```
