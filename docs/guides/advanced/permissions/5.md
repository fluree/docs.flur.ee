Congratulations! You've gotten through the Permissions section!

To summarize, you've learned:

1. How smart functions interact with permissions ([Lesson 1](/guides/advanced/permissions/1.md) or [Docs: Rule Usage](/concepts/smart-functions/rules.md#rules-usage))

2. Who signs transactions (auth record!) ([Lesson 2](/guides/advanced/permissions/2.md) or [Docs: Signatures](/concepts/identity/signatures.md))

3. How auth records, roles, and rules are structured ([Lesson 3](/guides/advanced/permissions/3.md) or [Docs: Auth/Role/Rule Structure](/concepts/identity/auth_records.md#auth-role-rule-structure))

4. How rules work ([Lesson 4](/guides/advanced/permissions/4.md) or [Docs: _rule Predicate](/overview/schema/identity.md#_rule))
