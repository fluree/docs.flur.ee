# Referencing Existing Entities

When adding or updating (next lesson!) data that includes existing references, you can refer to an existing subject by using either their subject id or a unique two-tuple.

For example, to create a new chat for the person with the handle, `jdoe`, we could issue:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "chat",
    "message": "This is Jane. Saying hi again",
    "person": ["person/handle", "jdoe"]
  }
]
```

Assuming her subject id is `1234567`, we could alternatively issue:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "chat",
    "message": "This is Jane. Saying hi again",
    "person": 1234567
  }
]
```

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Add a New Chat</h3>

<p>Using the above transaction examples, create a new chat message for a person whose subject id is 9876543.</p>
</div>
