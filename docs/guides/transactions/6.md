# Updating Data

In order to update data, you can reference an existing subject by using its `_id` or, for any predicate marked as unique as a two-tuple, i.e. `["_user/username", "jdoe"]`. Predicates that you wish to update should be included as key-value pairs.

When referencing an existing subject, `"_action": "update"` is inferred. Note: When updating and upserting, you can use nested transactions.

Update using a two-tuple with a unique predicate. i.e. `person/handle` and relevant object:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": ["person/handle", "jdoe"],
    "fullName": "Jane Doe Updated"
  }
]
```

Update using subject id:

```json
[
  {
    "_id": 351843720888321,
    "fullName": "Jane Doe Updated By Numeric _id"
  }
]
```

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Update Jane Doe's Handle</h3>
<h4>Write a transaction!</h4>
<br/>
<p>Using the above transaction examples, write a transaction updating Jane Doe's handle to "janieD".</p>
</div>
