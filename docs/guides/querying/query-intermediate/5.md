# Where Clauses

Where clauses allow you to filter subjects according to predicate ranges. You cannot use both `from` and `where` clauses in the same query.

Where clauses can use the following operations: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, and `=`.

For example, to select all movie's with budgets over $1,000, we could issue:

```json
{
    "select": ["*"],
    "where": "movie/budget > 1000"
}
```

Note that in where clauses, you need to use the full, namespaced version of a predicate (i.e. `movie/budget`, not just `budget`).

You can string multiple filters together using `AND` or `OR`. You cannot use both `AND` and `OR` in the same clause.

For example, to get all movies with a budget over $1,000 AND under $10,000, we could issue:

```json
{
    "select": ["*"],
    "where": "movie/budget > 1000 AND movie/budget < 10000"
}
```

<div class="challenge">
<h3>Select all movies with budgets under $1,000 OR over $1,000,000</h3>
</div>
