# Querying the Movie Ledger

Let's imagine we have a ledger full of movies. This ledger has the following collections:

- actor
- credit
- keyword
- genre
- language
- country
- productionCompany
- movies

The code below will select all predicates from any collection. Simply replace the `_______` with the name of any collection you would like to query.

```json
{
    "select": ["*"],
    "from": "_______"
}
```
