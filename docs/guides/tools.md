# Fluree Tools

## Fluree on Docker {#docker}

You can use Fluree in Docker. Visit the [Docker Example repo on Github](https://github.com/fluree/ledger-docker-compose-example) to get started with an example.

Or issue:

```bash
docker pull fluree/ledger:latest
```

then

```bash
docker run -p 8090:8090 fluree/ledger
```

from a terminal to get started right away.

More about this subject coming to the developer's site soon...

## Fluree CLI {#fluree-cli}

We have a command line tool that you can [download](https://fluree-cli-releases-public.s3.amazonaws.com/fluree_cli-latest.zip) to explore your ledger even without Fluree running. To see all the tool's capabilities, visit the [documentation](https://github.com/fluree/fluree.cli).

## VS Code Extension {#vs-code-extension}

If you use Visual Studio Code, you can [download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Fluree.fluree) the extension here. The [Github repo](https://github.com/fluree/vscode-fluree) is also available for review.
