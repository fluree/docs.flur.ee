# An Introduction to GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language designed by Facebook for graph-style ledgers. Fluree supports a wide selection of GraphQL features, but not all.

Both queries and transactions are supported in Fluree's version of GraphQL. GraphQL, like FlureeQL, returns results in the same shape as your request. This is helpful for application-designers and is intuitive for graph-style ledgers.

If you don't already know GraphQL, we recommend using FlureeQL. FlureeQL is a JSON-format that is designed for Fluree's advanced query capabilities.
