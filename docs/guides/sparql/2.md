# SPARQL Select Clause

The SELECT clause in SPARQL is a list of all the variables that you want displayed in your results.

All SPARQL variables begin with a "?". For example, this is a valid SELECT clause:

```sparql
SELECT ?chat ?message ?person ?handle ?fullName
```

As you can see above, `SELECT` should be in all caps, and there are no commas between variables, only spaces.

You can also include aggregate items in your select clause. These items are structured as follows: `(AVG(?favNums) AS ?avg)` where `AVG` can be any of a number of [accepted aggregate variables](/overview/query/sparql.md#select-clause).

For example:

```sparql
SELECT ?favNums (AVG(?favNums) AS ?avg) ?person ?handle (MAX(?favNums) as ?max)
```
