# Queries Across Sources

You've been told that SPARQL queries can allow you to query across sources, and that the `fd:` in front of predicates meant `Fluree`. Now, it's time to actually learn how to query across sources.

The concept is pretty simple: each triple refers to a particular dataset. A single triple cannot reference multiple datasets.

If every item in a triple is a variable, we assume that your datasource is Fluree, but you can specify otherwise by listing a prefix in front of any variable, for example `?creator fd:?label ?artwork`.

The most up-to-date list of [supported sources is available here](/overview/query/sparql.md#sources).

In this lesson, we'll focus on three sources:

1. The current Fluree
2. The Fluree as of a given point in time
3. Wikidata sources

There are multiple ways to specify Fluree, including `fd` and `fdb`. In order to use a Fluree as of a given block, simply add a number after the prefix, for example `fdb3`.

The following query has triples that use the current Fluree as a source, as well as a previous version of the Fluree as a source:

```sparql
SELECT ?person ?favNums
WHERE {
    ?person fd:person/favNums ?favNums;
            fd3:person/favNums ?favNums.
}
```
