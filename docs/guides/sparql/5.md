# Multiple Triples - Part 2

If two triples contain the same subject, then we can shorten the triples by using a semicolon `;` after the first clause and omitting the subject in all subsequent triples that share a subject. Make sure that the final clause in the group is has a period . at the end.

For example:

```sparql
WHERE {
  ?person fd:person/handle "jdoe";
          fd:person/fullName ?fullName;
          fd:person/favNums  ?favNums.
}
```

If two triples contain the same subject and the same predicate, then we can shorten the triples by using a comma `,` after the first clause and omitting both the subject and predicate in all subsequent clauses that share both a subject and a predicate. Spacing, tabs, and new-lines do not effect the result of the query. In the examples, we write both objects on the same line for readability.

```sparql
WHERE {
  ?person fd:person/handle "jdoe", "zsmith".
}
```
