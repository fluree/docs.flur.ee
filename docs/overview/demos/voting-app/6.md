# Creating Rules - Part 2

In the previous lessons, we added 5 rules. In order for them to be triggered when transactions are issued, we need to attach them to a role.

Thankfully, we've already created a role, `voter`, that is attached to all of the auth records in our ledger.

We'll give you the code for adding the rules to the relevant rule.

```json
[
  {
    "_id": ["_role/id", "voter"],
    "rules": [
      ["_rule/id", "editChanges"],
      ["_rule/id", "editVotes"],
      ["_rule/id", "editOwnUser"],
      ["_rule/id", "viewUsers"],
      ["_rule/id", "viewAuth"]
    ]
  }
]
```

In this section, we'll challenge you to figure out what comes next.

The `vote/yesVotes` and `vote/noVotes` predicates contain references to the records that approve (yesVotes) or disapprove (noVotes) of the relevant changes.

<div class="challenge">
<h3>What Comes Next?</h3>

<p>What smart function (restriction) should we add to the predicate, vote/yesVotes and vote/noVotes?</p>

<p>We expect you to answer using words, rather than trying to write the code of the smart function yourself.</p>
