# Creating Our Schema

In our schema, we'll have one collection, `wallet`, with three predicates:

- `wallet/user` - a reference to a `_user` (a built-in ledger collection)
- `wallet/balance`
- `wallet/name`

Do you remember how to create a schema?

- Remember, you need to specify a `type`. The most basic and common types are `int` (numbers), `string` (text), and `ref` (references). For a `ref` type, it is good practice to specify a `restrictCollection`, so the `ref` can only refer to a subject in a specific collection.

- Some predicates may also need to be `unique`.
